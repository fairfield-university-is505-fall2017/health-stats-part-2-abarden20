    "<!--- Write an explanation of the Waist To Hips Ratio statistic used by health professionals. Please include an explanation of what it is used for, exactly how it is calculated, and how to interpret the results. Note: Formmatting matters. Make this as professional as you can using Markdown.  --->\n",
    "####Summary:\n",
    "Waist–hip ratio or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is the dimensionless ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips.\n",
    "####How it is Calculated:\n",
    "This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (W ÷ H). \n",
    "####Interpreting the Results:\n",
    "The WHR has been used as an indicator or measure of health, and the risk of developing serious health conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "######Resource\n",
    "*As written in wikipedia.org: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist%E2%80%93hip_ratio*"
